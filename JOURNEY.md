# The Journey Behind UHP

I'm a journeyman electrician with IBEW Local 177. I spend my days running conduit, pulling wire, and troubleshooting electrical systems in commercial buildings across Northeast Florida.

But at night, I'm deep in cryptography textbooks, blockchain whitepapers, and Rust documentation.

This is the story of how I got here—and why I'm building UHP.

## The Late Start

I didn't discover computer science until my mid-20s.

In high school, I thought computers were just for gaming and homework. I had no idea you could *build* them, *program* them, or *secure* them. If someone had shown me what was possible—cryptography, distributed systems, quantum computing—I would have gone to college for this in a heartbeat.

But I didn't know. So I became an electrician.

It's honest work. I'm good at it. And honestly? There's something deeply satisfying about solving a power distribution problem or diagnosing a weird ground fault. Electrical systems are like puzzles—you trace the circuits, find the issue, and fix it.

Turns out, that's exactly the same mindset you need for computer science.

## The Spark

Around 2018, someone told me about Bitcoin. Not the "get rich quick" part—the *technology*. The idea that you could create a system where strangers could agree on truth without trusting each other.

I started reading. And I couldn't stop.

I learned about public-key cryptography. Merkle trees. Proof-of-work. Then I found Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL)—a blockchain designed to survive quantum computers using XMSS signatures.

That was it. I was hooked.

I taught myself Python. Then JavaScript. Then Solidity. Then Rust. I spent nights and weekends mining QRL, building projects, studying cryptographic protocols. I went from zero to reaching second-round interviews at major AI companies.

All self-taught. All while working full-time as an electrician.

## The Regret (And The Drive)

I'm in my early 30s now. Sometimes I think about what I could have accomplished if I'd known about this world in high school. If I'd gone to college for computer science instead of trade school.

But here's the thing: **regret can either paralyze you or push you forward.**

I choose the latter.

I can't get those years back. But I can make the next 10 count. I can build something that matters. I can prove that you don't need a Stanford degree or a Google internship to contribute something meaningful to the future of the internet.

## What I'm Trying to Do

I want to break into Web3 security auditing. I want to work with smart contracts, cryptographic protocols, decentralized systems. I want to be the person who finds vulnerabilities before attackers do.

But here's the reality: **it's hard to break in when you're self-taught.**

Nobody's going to hire a journeyman electrician to audit their Solidity contracts, no matter how many Rust projects I've built or how well I understand XMSS signatures.

So I have two options:
1. **Find the right person to give me a chance**
2. **Create my own chance**

UHP is me creating my own chance.

## The OAuth Fragmentation Problem

I was building a side project and needed social login. "Sign in with Google" took 30 minutes to implement—worked perfectly.

Then a user messaged me: **"Can you add GitHub OAuth? I don't have a Google account."**

Fine. I added GitHub. Then someone wanted Apple. Then Microsoft. Then Facebook.

That's when I realized: **OAuth 2.0 is brilliant, but it's fragmented.**

Every website picks different providers. Users need accounts with Google, Apple, GitHub, Microsoft just to log in. Developers have to integrate 5 different OAuth implementations, each with different APIs, callback formats, and token structures.

OAuth was supposed to eliminate per-website credentials. But it just replaced that problem with per-provider dependencies.

---

## The Insight

What if there was **ONE** universal OAuth provider that:
- Worked on every website (like email, but for authentication)
- Wasn't controlled by any single company (federated, like email servers)
- Used quantum-resistant cryptography (future-proof)
- Required no email address (privacy-first)
- Anyone could run their own instance (open protocol)

That's **UHP (Universal Handle Protocol).**

In the 1970s, messaging had the same problem—CompuServe users couldn't message AOL users. Email (SMTP) solved it with a federated protocol. You can email anyone@anywhere.com, regardless of provider.

**UHP brings that same federation to authentication.**

---

## Why This Matters

**For users:** One handle, one login, everywhere. No more "Sorry, we only accept Google accounts."

**For developers:** Integrate OAuth once, works everywhere. No more adding GitHub, then Apple, then Microsoft...

**For the future:** Quantum-resistant, federated, no single point of failure. A protocol that belongs to everyone.

---

## This Is My Shot

I'm not waiting for permission. I'm not waiting for someone to "give me a chance."

I'm building UHP because:
1. **The world needs it** (OAuth fragmentation is a real problem)
2. **I can build it** (6-7 years of self-taught CS/crypto prepared me for this)
3. **It's my proof of work** (better than any resume or degree)

If UHP succeeds—even partially—it opens doors. Web3 security firms, protocol development teams, cryptography research groups. They'll see: "This guy built a quantum-resistant, federated OAuth protocol. He understands XMSS, PKI, WebAuthn, OAuth 2.0."

And if it doesn't? I'll have learned more building it than I could in a year of interviews.

## What Comes Next

If you're reading this, you're probably:
- **A developer** who's tired of integrating 5 OAuth providers
- **A security researcher** interested in post-quantum cryptography
- **Someone building in Web3** who wants better identity infrastructure
- **Or maybe you're like me**—self-taught, trying to break in, looking to prove yourself

If that last one is you: **Build something.**

Not because it's guaranteed to work. Not because VCs will fund it. Not because it's "practical."

Build it because the world needs it. And because you can.

## Let's Build The Future

UHP isn't a startup. It's not a token. It's not a company.

**It's a protocol.** Like email. Like HTTP. Like Bitcoin.

Open-source. Permissionless. Built by electricians who taught themselves cryptography, PhD students with brilliant ideas, and developers who are just tired of OAuth fragmentation.

If you want to help:
- **GitHub:** [github.com/RealHaywoodJ/uhp-protocol](https://github.com/RealHaywoodJ/uhp-protocol)
- **Email:** et.munson91@protonmail.com
- **Read the whitepaper:** [uhp-whitepaper.md](./uhp-whitepaper.md)

Let's replace the fragmented OAuth landscape with something better.

Let's build the post-email internet.

**P.S.:** If you're a Web3 security firm, protocol dev team, or cryptography research group looking for someone who understands post-quantum crypto, distributed systems, and OAuth 2.0 at a deep level—I'm looking for my next opportunity. Let's talk.
